<h1>The Journey Begins!</h1>

INLS 161 has **so far** taught me the technicalities and specifics of many things I already had a general understanding of. I already understood concepts like **GitHub**, **servers** (and how much I hated **[PokemonGo](http://ispokemongodownornot.com/)**’s), **domains**, **Linux**, and **CSS**, but now I not only understand the concept of them, but what they really are and how they work. I can use each of these things, among others, to achieve different goals and meet my needs—not only individually, but I can manipulate them to work with each other to make it even easier for me.

<p>Getting to this point (not that I’m saying I’m at any particularly advanced point) has at times not been the easiest. There have been times in class that I was pretty sure I had missed the entire lesson, and that it had all gone right over my head. When I went home to practice, I was even surer of it. (<strong>“What did <code>–a</code> do again? What is the dot? What is the two dot? What did I have to add to this phrase to make it stage commits? Did I just break it? I think I just broke it. How do I make a paragraph? Why are there hashtags everywhere?! THIS ISN’T TWITTER. GOD WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING! *cry*”</strong>) However, throughout the struggles, I did my best to try to keep going, trying again, and asking for help from the professor, my classmates, and my friends, until I grasped whatever I was learning. Now, typing in <code>pwd</code> or <code>git status</code> when I’m totally lost is second nature, and my understanding of these two incredibly basic things makes me comfortable and confident enough to continue through the cluelessness (instead of crying).</p>
